# Cryptography-I-Week-4-Quiz
An attacker intercepts the following ciphertext (hex encoded):  20814804c1767293b99f1d9cab3bc3e7 ac1e37bfb15599e5f40eef805488281d  He knows that the plaintext is the ASCII encoding of the message "Pay Bob 100$" (excluding the quotes). He also knows that the cipher used is CBC encryption with a random IV using AES as the underlying block cipher.  Show that the attacker can change the ciphertext so that it will decrypt to "Pay Bob 500$". What is the resulting ciphertext (hex encoded)?  This shows that CBC provides no integrity.
